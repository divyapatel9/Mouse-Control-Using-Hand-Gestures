# Hand Gesture Mouse Control

This repository contains code for controlling the mouse cursor using hand gestures captured through a webcam. It provides an intuitive and hands-free way to interact with a computer, particularly useful for scenarios where traditional input devices are not feasible or convenient.

## Features

- **Hand Gesture Recognition:** Utilizes computer vision techniques to recognize hand gestures captured by a webcam.
- **Mouse Control:** Maps detected hand gestures to corresponding mouse movements, enabling control of the mouse cursor.
- **Volume and Click Control:** Performs the function of adjusting the volume my using the index finger of both the hands. Also perofrms single and double click.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with the computer using hand gestures.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- PyAutoGUI
- Should be sitting in the ideal position and distance from the camera should be at least greater than 1 feet.

 **Install Dependencies:**
pip install opencv-python pyautogui mediapipe
